## Overview
This project is a case study analyzing the performance of athletes, countries, medals, and sports during the Summer and Winter Olympics from **1896 to 2016**. The International Olympics Committee meticulously records athlete data, event details, and medal distributions. As an analyst for the Committee, this study uses **Tableau** to uncover trends and insights that highlight the evolution of the Games over more than a century.

## Dataset
The dataset contains two tables: one for athlete data and another for medal data. These tables are joined using the **Data Blending** technique in Tableau for comprehensive analysis.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
1. Join the tables using **Data Blending** after importing them to Tableau.
2. Create a **Stacked Bar Visual** to display the medal distribution of the top 10 countries, broken down into Bronze, Silver, and Gold medals.
3. Analyze the **age distribution of athletes** participating in different sports using a histogram to identify the dominant age groups.
4. Analyze the **medal distribution by age group** for Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals using a histogram.
5. Visualize the **gender distribution** of athletes in the Olympics using a Donut chart with a country filter for user-specific selection.
6. Use a **Side-by-Side Bar Chart** to display the gender-wise distribution of overall medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
7. Create a **Line Chart** to show the trend of Olympic participation over the years, highlighting the total number of athletes per edition.
8. Develop a **Line Chart** to showcase the trend of countries participating over time.
9. Visualize the top sports by the total number of medals using a **Treemap**.
10. Use a **Filled Map** to show the total number of medals each country has received.
11. Create a **Line Chart** to visualize the number of teams participating in both Summer and Winter Olympics simultaneously.
12. Develop KPIs for **Total Medals**, **Gold Medals**, **Silver Medals**, **Bronze Medals**, **Total Athletes**, and **Total Sports**.

## Insights
Key insights from the analysis are as follows:
- Out of 206 participating countries, the **USA** won the most medals, followed by **Russia** and **Germany**.
- The majority of athletes who participated in the Olympics fall within the **20 to 30 years** age group, and this group also won the maximum number of medals.
- Sports like **Athletics**, **Gymnastics**, **Swimming**, **Shooting**, and **Fencing** have seen the highest medal counts.
- Among all participants, **60% were male** and **40% were female**, with male athletes winning the majority of the medals.

## Conclusion
The Olympics Data Analysis provides valuable insights into athlete performance, the dominance of certain countries and sports, and the evolving trends in Olympic participation over time. This analysis helps to better understand the factors that contribute to success in the Olympic Games and offers guidance for future strategy and development.
